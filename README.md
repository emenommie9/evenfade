# Evenfade

Evenfade is an open source computer role-playing game (CRPG) with a heavy focus on user created content. The game is in early development and there is not much to see yet. 

The game is inspired by games such as Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate. It allows the player to select an adventure to play. They will then create or import their character(s) and start the adventure. The adventure will then dictate the world they will navigate, telling the story through combat, conversation and puzzles. The characters will advance through experience levels and equipment upgrades throughout the adventure in a classic role-playing sense.

The game will also allow for multiple players to play through an adventure or for a dedicated server to host a persistent adventure for players to join and leave as they wish.
